    This is the first post in this portfolio blog.
    The purpose of this blog is to demonstrate my skills as a developer and to show off a little bit more of who I am
    than a traditional CV can. It can also be used to give some insight into the work I'm capable of doing.

    Why is this website made using React?
</h2>
<p>
    This website is made in React purely because it's popular in a workplace environment,
    and I wanted to show off. Realistically, this website is simple enough to exist purely as 
    html/css, but then I wouldn't be able to say that I have a personal React page.

<h2>
    Why not use a tool like Next.js for Static Site Generation?
</h2>
<p>
    I felt as though it would be a better presentation of my ability to make it without Next.
    I've looked at Next a little bit, and they even have a sample blog that does everything for you.
    All you have to do is just write up your blogposts in markdown files, and it provides all of the 
    components and styling. I would probably use it in a production environment if I needed to start fresh
    on a project, but I felt that it showed off my knowledge more to not use it.
