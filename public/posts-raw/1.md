# Creating a Portfolio Website to Learn React
Throughout my first schooling and first two years of work experience, I have not had any formal training in frontend development. In College, I was an electrical engineering major. I had several programming classes, but the strong majority of them were focused on low-level C/C++/Assembly/OpenGL, or they would use the high level mathematical language, MATLAB. I had ran through the curriculum for the Introduction to Java course, since I was originally selected to be a teaching assistant for the course, but I was swapped into a circuits class at the last minute.

Then, during my time at NICE, I've primarily done backend work in Typescript. I will occasionally work in C#, but a majority of the work I've done has been in Typescript.

I decided to rewrite my portfolio website, and I wanted to use a modern web technology like React. I also researched Next.JS, but I decided against it due to the small scope of my portfolio website.

# Goals
My goals for the website was to make a home page that could display a short bio and pictures, a list of projects that I've worked on with links to those projects, a contact/resume page, and a list of rudimentary blog posts that would be written in markdown.
