# Hosting a React App on GitHub Pages
There are several techniques for deploying and hosting React frontends. You could use a cloud provider's tools, like AWS Amplify or host straight from AWS Cloudfront. Or you could set up a dedicated machine or EC2 instance to serve the single page application. One cheap, simple alternative is GitHub Pages.

GitHub pages is a hosting service that allows you to serve publicly available html, javascript, and css files directly from a GitHub repository. Since you can normally traverse through a projects file structure and view the raw html via the GitHub UI, they added the feature to serve that html file as well. The catch is that your page needs to be open source and public on GitHub. This downside doesn't typically apply for student projects and personal portfolios however, since those will likely be open source anyway to demonstrate the work done. 

# Setting Up the Project
When I've done this process to host React applications, I've created them using `create-react-app`. This could be done without using that tool, but all of my experience surrounds that tool. To start, you just run:

`yarn create react-app my-app --template typescript`

Then you can install an npm package named `gh-pages` with:

`yarn add gh-pages`

(You can add this as a dev dependency or regular dependency if you like) This package will create a build folder that is minified and gzipped, and it deploys it directly to GitHub in a branch named `gh-pages`

As long as you have an `index.html` in this folder, then the website should be deployable.

To deploy the GitHub page, you will need to modify the `package.json` of the project, and add the following commands and setup:

```json
{
    // ... NORMAL PACKAGE.JSON
    "homepage": "username.github.io/HOME_PAGE", // for me, this is "https://samfoucart.github.io/portfolio"
    // ...
    "scripts": {
        // ... NORMAL SCRIPTS
        "deploy": "gh-pages -d build",
    }
    // ...
}
```

# Accessing Static Assets from Javascript
When creating this app, you'll probably want to access images, svgs, static json files, or any other filetype like markdown. In this personal website, I have a json that simulates a key-value/document database like Dynamo or Mongo, then I fetch the contents of the json to display them to the UI. This json file is my blog posts list. It's a mapping of the metadata of each blog post to the filename of the markdown blog post in git.

The `create-react-app` tool should create a `public` folder. Everything in this folder gets copied to the `build` directory and can be
